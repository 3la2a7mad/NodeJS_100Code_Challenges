First, My load balancer is sending all live traffic to the "Blue" environment, which is My current, stable version of the app.
Meanwhile, I'll deploy the new app version to an identical "Green" environment that's completely separate from live
traffic for final testing.
Once I'm confident it's working, I just reconfigure the load balancer to instantly route all traffic to Green,
which gives me a zero-downtime deployment and an immediate rollback option if needed.
